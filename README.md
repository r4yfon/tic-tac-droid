## About the Project

This project is a simple yet functional implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, designed for two players. The game allows players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid until one player achieves three consecutive marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Developed entirely in **Kotlin**, ensuring a modern and efficient codebase.
- Intuitive user interface for a seamless gameplay experience.
- Clear game rules and real-time feedback during gameplay.
- Minimalistic design focused on functionality and ease of use.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your machine:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or later)
- **Android Studio** (latest stable version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r4yfon/tic-tac-droid.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Allow Android Studio to download all required dependencies.
4. Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical Android device.

## How to Play

1. Launch the application on your Android device.
2. The game begins with an empty 3×3 grid.
3. Two players take turns to place their marks (e.g., `X` and `O`).
4. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If the grid is fully occupied without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
